FRIDA: FRI-based DOA Estimation for Arbitrary Array Layout
==================================

This repository contains all the code to reproduce the results of the paper
[*FRIDA: FRI-based DOA Estimation for Arbitrary Array Layout*](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/223649).

*FRIDA* is a new algorithm for direction of arrival (DOA) estimation
for acoustic sources. This repository contains a python implementation
of the algorithm, as well as five conventional methods: MUSIC, SRP-PHAT, CSSM,
WAVES, and TOPS (in the `doa` folder).

A number of scripts were written to evaluate the performance of FRIDA and the
other algorithms in different scenarios. Monte-Carlo simulations were used to
study the noise robustness and the minimum angle of separation for close source
resolution (`figure_doa_separation.py`, `figure_doa_synthetic.py`).  A number
of experiment on recorded data were done and the scripts for processing this
data are also available (`figure_doa_experiment.py`,
`figure_doa_9_mics_10_src.py`).

We are available for any question or request relating to either the code
or the theory behind it. Just ask!

Abstract
--------

In this paper we present FRIDA --- an algorithm for estimating directions of
arrival of multiple wideband sound sources. FRIDA combines multi-band
information coherently and achieves state-of-the-art resolution at extremely
low signal-to-noise ratios. It works for arbitrary array layouts, but unlike
the various steered response power and subspace methods, it does not require a
grid search. FRIDA leverages recent advances in sampling signals with a finite
rate of innovation. It is based on the insight that for any array layout, the
entries of the spatial covariance matrix can be linearly transformed into a
uniformly sampled sum of sinusoids.

Recreate the figures and sound samples
--------------------------------------

The first step is to make sure that all the dependencies are satisfied.
Check this in the Dependencies section or just run the following to check if you are missing something.

    python check_requirements.py

If some dependencies are missing, they can be installed with `pip`.

Second, download the recordings data by running the following at the root of the
repository

    wget https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/l5qiXlfT0rLurXl
    tar xzfv FRIDA_recordings.tar.gz

For a quick test that everythin works, you can run the main script in test mode. This will run just one loop
of every simulation.

    ./make_all_figures.sh -t

For the real deal, run the same command without any options.

    ./make_all_figures.sh

Parallel computation engines can be used by adding `-n X` where X is the number of engines to use. Typically this is the number of cores available minus one.

    ./make_all_figures.sh -n X

Alternatively, start an ipython cluster

    ipcluster start -n <number_workers>
    
and then type in the following commands in an ipython shell.

    # Simulation with different SNR values
    %run figure_doa_synthetic.py -f <filename>
    %run figure_doa_synthetic_plot.py -f <filename>

    # Simulation of closely spaced sources
    %run figure_doa_separation.py -f <filename>
    %run figure_doa_separation_plot.py -f <filename>

    # Experiment on speech recordings
    %run figure_doa_experiment.py -f <filename>
    %run figure_doa_experiment_plot.py -f <filename>

    # Experiment with 10 loudspeakers and 9 microphones
    %run figure_doa_9_mics_10_src.py -o <filename>
    %run figure_doa_9_mics_10_src_plot.py -f <filename>

The data is saved in the `data` folder and the figures generated are collected in `figures`.

Data used in the paper
----------------------

The output from the simulation and processing that
was used for the figures in the paper is stored in
the repository in the following files.

Recorded Data
-------------

The recorded speech and noise samples used in the experiment have been
published separately in dataverse
[doi:10.7910/DVN/SVQBEP](http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/SVQBEP).  We also
provide a [direct download
link](https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/l5qiXlfT0rLurXl) for convenience.
The folder containing the recordings should be at the root of the repository
and named `recordings`.  Detailed description and instructions are provided
along the data.

    wget https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/l5qiXlfT0rLurXl
    tar xzfv FRIDA_recordings.tar.gz

Overview of results
-------------------

We implemented for comparison five algorithms: incoherent MUSIC, SRP-PHAT, CSSM, WAVES, and TOPS.

### Influence of Noise (Fig. 1A)

We compare the robustness to noise of the different algorithms when a single source is present.

### Resolving power (Fig. 1B)

We study the resolution power of the different algorithms. How close can two sources become
before the algorithm breaks down.

### Experiment on speech data (Fig. 2C)

We record signals from 8 loudspeakers with 1, 2, or 3 sources active simultaneously. We use
the algorithm to reconstruct the DOA and plot the statistics of the error.

### Experiment with more sources than microphone (Fig. 2D)

FRIDA can identifies DOA of more sources than it uses microphones. We demonstrate
this by playing 10 loudspeakers simultaneously and recovering all DOA with only
9 microphones.

Dependencies
------------

For a quick check of the dependencies, run

    python check_requirements.py

The script `system_install.sh` was used to install all the required software on a blank UBUNTU Xenial server.

* A working distribution of [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [Scipy](http://www.scipy.org/)
* We use the distribution [anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) to simplify the setup of the environment.
* Computations are very heavy and we use the
  [MKL](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/mkl-optimizations/) extension of
  Anaconda to speed things up. There is a [free license](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/academicanaconda) for academics.
* We used ipyparallel and joblib for parallel computations.
* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) and [seaborn](https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/index.html#) for plotting the results.

The pyroomacoustics is used for STFT, fractionnal delay filters, microphone arrays generation, and some more.

    pip install git+https://github.com/LCAV/pyroomacoustics

List of standard packages needed

    numpy, scipy, pandas, ipyparallel, seaborn, zmq, joblib

In addition the two following libraries are not really needed to recreate the figures, but were used to resample and process the recording files

    scikits.audiolab, sickits.samplerate

They require install of shared libraries

    # Ubuntu code
    apt-get install libsndfile1 libsndfile1-dev libsamplerate0 libsamplerate0-dev  # Ubuntu

    # OS X install
    brew install libsndfile
    brew install libsamplerate
